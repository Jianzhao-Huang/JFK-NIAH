This has likely increased agricultural productivity and improved food security for the military. The reforms have also contributed to a sense of empowerment among peasants, as they are now more directly involved in agricultural production, which supports the military's needs. Overall, the reforms have strengthened the economic foundation for both the peasant population and the military.",
