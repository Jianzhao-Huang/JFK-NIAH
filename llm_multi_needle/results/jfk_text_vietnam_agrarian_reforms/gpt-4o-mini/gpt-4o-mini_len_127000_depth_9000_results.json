This has likely improved agricultural productivity and self-sufficiency among the peasant population. For the military, these reforms have ensured a steady supply of food, enhancing their operational capabilities and support during conflicts. Overall, the reforms have contributed to both economic stability for peasants and logistical support for military operations.",
