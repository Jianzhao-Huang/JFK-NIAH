The reforms aimed to solve the land problem for peasants, providing them with access to land and resources, which in turn constituted a food source for troops and cadres. This increased agricultural output supported both the local economy and military needs, enhancing food security for the military while empowering peasants economically. The reforms contributed to a more stable agricultural sector, which was crucial for sustaining the war effort and fostering rural development.",
