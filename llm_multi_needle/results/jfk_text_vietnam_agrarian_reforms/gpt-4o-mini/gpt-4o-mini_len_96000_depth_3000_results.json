    "model_response": "Vietnam's agrarian reforms have economically benefited peasants by solving the land problem, providing them with access to land and resources, which has become a food source for both the troops and cadres. This has likely improved their livelihoods and contributed to agricultural productivity. However, the military's economic impact is less clear, as the reforms may have shifted focus and resources towards supporting the peasant population, potentially affecting military funding and operations. Overall, the reforms have fostered a more stable agricultural base, which is crucial for both civilian and military needs.",
